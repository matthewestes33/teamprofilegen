## Features

The user can input employee information about team members directly into the command line through a series of prompts.

The user's team compilation starts with manager questions, and presents a menu allowing input for engineer or intern information before completing the data capture. 

After completing the prompts, the user is provided with a clear message, indicating the team roster has been generated onto a formatted HTML page. 

On the HTML page, the user is provided links to each team member's email address, and every engineer's GitHub profile.
